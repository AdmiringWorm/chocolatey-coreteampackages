Papercut SMTP is a 2-in-1 quick email viewer AND built-in SMTP server (designed to receive messages only). Papercut SMTP doesn't enforce any restrictions on how you prepare your email, but it allows you to view the whole email-chilada: body, HTML, headers, and attachment right down to the naughty raw encoded bits. Papercut can be configured to run on startup and sit quietly (minimized in the tray) only providing a notification when a new message has arrived.

## Features

- Instant Feedback When New Email Arrives
- Rich and Detailed View of Received Email
- View and Download the Mime Sections of your Email

## Package Parameters

- `/InstallDir:PATH` - Override the path where Papercut should be installed.
